#A dialog flow must always begin with >begin start
#Text in the start block will be in the chat when the users joins/opens/sees the chat.
#
#+name indicates a block of text to be shown with no input in between.
#To indicate who is doing the dialog use @talker
#To have a pause between messages use %sec for a delay in secondes.
#To indicate what block to show next use >next block_name.
#
#The choise variable will receive a numeric choise in string in between each block
#
#To precess a choise do the following:
#
#+example
#You have 3 choises
#choise 1
#choise 2
#choise 3
#+>next +exampleChoises
#
#+exampleChoises
#+
#>{ifeq $choise "1"}next exampleChosen1{/}
#>{ifeq $choise "2"}next exampleChosen2{/}
#>{ifeq $choise "3"}next exampleChosen3{/}
#>skip
#
#If the user inputs a choise outside of the range of possible choises it will loop back until they do.
#
#To indicate a users final choise in a dialog use 
#>set $result resultnumber
#
#To indicate the dialog has ended use:
#>set $endOfConvo true
